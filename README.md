# Interactive Image Viewing Tool
***Start:** July 18<sup>th</sup> 2023, **Finish:** August 2<sup>nd</sup> 2023*

For a second-year course: Graphical Programming

## Scenario
This program displays image files and provides some basic interactive features, using GUI components (provided by Java Swing) and event handlers.

**Functionality:**
- There a `File` menu with an `Open` item that allows the user to select and read an image file and display it in a panel. This menu also provides a `Quit` item.
- The user can read off and display the individual R, G, and B values of each pixel as the mouse is moved across the image.
- The user can "flip" the image horizontally, vertically, and a combination thereof, as well as bring the image back to its original orientation. This is done without copying the stored image.
- There is a feature to toggle to/from displaying image negative.

## What I learnt:
- GUI components (Java Swing) - eg. JFrame, JButton, JMenu, JTextField, etc.
- Images - how to load, draw, update, extract pixel colours, flip and negate.
- Event handlers - eg. ActionEvent, MouseEvent
